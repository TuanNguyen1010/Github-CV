<h1> Tuan Nguyen </h1>
I am a software engineer and alumnus of Makers Academy - an intensive 16 week coding bootcamp. Previously I studied Accounting and Finance, due to my enthusiasm for analysing data. Subsequently, through my interest in analysis and problem solving I discovered coding. I am currently looking to apply my passion for all things technical within a challenging environment.

<h2>
Skills
</h2>

<h4> Team work</h4> 
During Makers, I completed a technical group project which involved working in an agile team of 4 people across a 2 week long sprint. The project utilised Google Maps, Geolocation, OMDB and IMDB film APIs to allow users to identify the most popular critically acclaimed films by locations via clicking on a map-based GUI. I experienced a plethora of challenges, which included meeting the requirements of a MVP (minimum viable product) within the agreed time constraints. I ensured strong communication between my team and ensured we were able to efficiently plan out the challenges associated with learning and building a project within an entirely new framework (React).

<h4> Problem solving</h4>
I love solving complex problems through simplifying the problem by breaking it down into several smaller problems and applying systematic logic to develop an efficient solution. I feel that transferring parallel aspects from accounting to software development has allowed me to further dive into the intricacies of the code, this includes applying data analysis, transactional reviews and sharing best practice in team stand ups.

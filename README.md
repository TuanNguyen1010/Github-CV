<h1> Tuan Nguyen </h1>
I am a recent graduate from an intensive web development bootcamp. I left University studying accounting. On the seearch looking for fufilment in my life that accounting was not providing mem, I discoved coding, I loved the aspect of complex problems solving and creating things.  I am itching to start my career - I love the constant problem solving, iterative processes and continuous learning.

Skills
</h2>

<h4> Team work</h4> 
I have completed multiple projects in teams throughout my time at University and the bootcamp. Throughout my experience working in groups at the bootcamp, I've experienced a rollercoaster of emotions but thrived in these situations as maintaining postive team morale will always generate the best possible output. 

<h4> Communication </h4>
I've been working in customer service for several years both in person and through a computer screen. What I learned most from all this experience is to match energy level and make everyone feel valued. 

<h4> Problem solving</h4>
I am very intrigued with the concept of solving complex problems through simplifying the problem and using logical thinking to come up with an efficient solution
